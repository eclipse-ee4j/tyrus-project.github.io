  <h2>Running the Draw Sample</h2>  
  <p>
    One of the samples in Tyrus is the Draw Sample. To run it, you need to add the following dependency to your pom file:  
  
    <pre class="programlisting">
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.tyrus&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;websocket-sample-draw&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.0-b04&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    </pre>
    
    Maven downloads the file websocket-sample-draw-1.0-b04.war during the built. </BR>  
    Now you need to download sources for the previous artefact and run the Main class - this starts the Draw server.</BR>
    In the next step, deploy the websocket-sample-draw-1.0-b04.war on the application server and access it via some browser supporting WebSocket. You will be able to draw on HTML 5 canvas.</BR> 
    If you access the same address from another browser tab, you will be able to draw on the canvas too and see in real-time what the other connected hosts are drawing.</BR></BR>
